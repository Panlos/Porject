 * 
 * exercise category
 * "exercisecategory": "https://wger.de/api/v2/exercisecategory/"
 *

 * "exerciseinfo": "https://wger.de/api/v2/exerciseinfo/"
 * 
 * Maybe the exercises?? We shall see
 * "exercise": "https://wger.de/api/v2/exercise/"
 * 
 * I could attach a video link if possible have it only visable to be seen if it's clicked on like a drop down tab
 * to reduce the amount that is on the screen
 * "video": "https://wger.de/api/v2/video/"
 * 
 * Image could be helpful as well for people
 * "exerciseimage": "https://wger.de/api/v2/exerciseimage/"
 * 
 * 
 * Comments are useful tips that could be along side the description found in the info one as well
 * "exercisecomment": "https://wger.de/api/v2/exercisecomment/"
 * 
 * 
 * I think i will have to work the the JSON data a bit and see how they actually come out on screen and that
 * worse case is I just put all the data into a file like week 5 and that
